
The code you've provided implements the Visitor design pattern.

Here's why:

Interface: You have an interface Alert which declares the method alert(AlertVisitor alertVisitor). This method accepts an AlertVisitor parameter, which is the key component of the Visitor pattern.

Concrete Elements: The SmartPhone, TV, and Radio classes implement the Alert interface. Each of these classes has a method alert(AlertVisitor alertVisitor) where they call alertVisitor.visit(this). This is typical of the Visitor pattern where elements accept a visitor and call the visitor's method, passing itself as an argument.

Visitor Interface: You have an interface AlertVisitor which declares methods visit(SmartPhone smartphone), visit(TV tv), and visit(Radio radio). This interface defines the operations that can be performed on the elements.

Concrete Visitor: The AlertDisplayVisitor class implements the AlertVisitor interface and provides concrete implementations for each visit method. This class encapsulates the operations to be performed on the elements.

Client Code: In the Main class, you create instances of the concrete elements (SmartPhone, TV, and Radio) and call the alert method on each, passing an instance of AlertDisplayVisitor as an argument. This is how the elements accept visitors and perform operations on them without knowing the specifics of those operations, adhering to the Visitor pattern.

Therefore, the program you provided demonstrates the Visitor design pattern.
